# rvepp-ml
Repository for the Machine Learning model related work for RVEPP.

The work is split into three components:
* Data Generation (either synthetic or extraction from samples)
* Model Training via the Trainer Application
* Testing Predictions and Evaluating the Model

The focus initially will be on the trainer itself followed by the evaluator.
